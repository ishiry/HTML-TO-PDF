# HTML-TO-PDF
Recently i was going through some introductory tutorials in python. These tutorials, unlike the other common tutorials on the subject, were focused on users who have other programming knowledge background.

i personally would like to have these materials out as paper and read them over a cup of coffee (starbucks anyone??) Hence this project.
